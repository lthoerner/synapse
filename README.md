# Synapse
Synapse is a Fabric mod that aims to improve existing redstone components/mechanics, and to add new components/mechanics
in a way that does not majorly diverge from the vanilla redstone experience. You may think of it as something of an
"overhaul" mod for vanilla redstone.

## Current Features
- "Calibrated" torches and redstone blocks that output a specific constant signal strength
- More sensible music disc signal strength values
- Jukeboxes can be silenced and subsequently do not lock hoppers under them when discs are inserted
- Hoppers that face up

## Planned Features
### Definite Features
- Dispensers fill and empty cauldrons with buckets
- Powered detector rail hybrid so minecarts can be read and sent from the same rail
- Minecart gate that can be toggled with redstone
- Improved item transportation (better hopper speeds, splitting, filtering, maybe even-distribution)
### Tentative Features
- Some component or block that stores an input signal strength when powered (locked comparators?)
- Auto block breaker
- Dispensers can pick up shulker boxes
- Ender chests that can be configured to a particular player in order to work with hoppers and other storage tech
